Project Title
Exploratory Data Analysis and Preprocessing on Bank Marketing Dataset
Description
This task focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocessing on the bank marketing dataset to prepare it for predictive modeling. It involves understanding data distributions, visualizing relationships, handling missing values, and preparing features.
Dataset
•	The dataset used is “bank-full.csv” containing customer demographic, financial, and campaign information related to bank marketing efforts.
•	Key variables include age, job, marital status, education level, balance, loan status, and campaign details.
•	The target variable (to be used in prediction tasks later) is customer subscription to a term deposit.
Objectives
•	Load and explore dataset using statistical summaries and data visualization techniques.	•	Identify and handle missing or inconsistent data.
•	Visualize distributions and relationships between important features.	•	Encode categorical variables into machine-readable formats.
•	Normalize or scale features if necessary for future modeling.
Tools and Libraries
•	Python 3.x
•	Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
•	Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
•	Jupyter Notebook for code development and reporting
Workflow
1.	Load dataset and inspect data types and summary statistics.
2.	Explore key features with histograms, count plots, and pairplots.
3.	Detect and impute or handle missing data and outliers.
4.	Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
5.	Save preprocessed data for subsequent modeling in Task 3.
Expected Outcomes
•	Comprehensive understanding of dataset characteristics.
•	Cleaned and properly formatted dataset ready for machine learning.
•	Visual insights into important feature distributions and correlations.
•	Improved data quality supporting better model results in Task 3.
How to Use
•	Run the Jupyter notebook cells sequentially for EDA and preprocessing.
•	Review visualizations and documented observations.
•	Use the preprocessing code to prepare data for Task 3 modeling.
